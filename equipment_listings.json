    "description": "The Hammerhead GS-44 Grapple Saw is designed to pick up one log or multiple logs at a time and cut them from the safety of the operator cab.  Ideal for storm cleanup, sawmill yard, land clearing, logging, clearing hiking or biking or snowmobile trails, or for cutting logs to use in an outdoor wood boiler.  You simply grasp the log in the grapple and push a button to activate the hydraulic saw.  In addition to starting the saw, each time you press the saw button, it provides a squirt of oil to the saw bar from a dedicated bar oil tank built into the grapple saw.  This unit also works great for bucking up logs that are too big to fit in a firewood processor.  We offer this grapple saw in two versions, the standard version which has a 24\" diameter cut capacity and the XL which has a 30\" diameter max cut capacity.   Standard models come with the saw mounted on the right side of the grapple, or we offer an optional left mounted saws for use on excavators, telehandlers, and single boom skid steers from manufacturers like Volvo & JCB.  We also offer hydraulic saw motor options from Hydro Gear, Parker, & Sunfab.  The GS-44 Grapple Saw makes extensive use of high strength steel and incorporates industrial grade components to ensure excellent availability and a long service life._x000D_\nFor more information visit the Hammerhead Attachments website @ https://www.hammerheadattachments.com/rigid-grapple-saw.html"

With its standard 25 HP Kohler EFI or Optional Diesel upgrade, the 14-24 is capable of producing from 1 to 2 full cords of firewood per hour. The 14-24 will process up to 18\" diameter logs. This machine comes standard with a 2-strand live deck that can convert into a log lift. The integrated 10' hydraulic operated chain conveyor allows you to easily load firewood into a trailer or truck box. Hydraulic lever type controls operate the hydraulic saw, clamp, conveyor, and log lift. All 14-24's come standard with a hydraulically operated 4-way wedge, automatic bar oiler, last log measuring grid, and integrated taillights. Our one of a kind round log trough is built to better handle crooked logs at ease. A perfect machine for the homeowner who cuts firewood to heat his home or has a small firewood business. While the 14-24 is the smallest machine in the Brute Force line of processors, it is designed & built to the same standards as our larger machines. All Brute Force firewood processors are built to withstand the rigors of daily firewood production.\n\n https://youtu.be/zr49fg9j5iQ"

As the amps on the hammer mill climb the feed auger slows, when the amps reach a pre-set limit the feed conveyor stops to allow the hammer mill to catch up. This is all 3 phase 240v components. The hammer mill has a 1/4\" screen, which is the correct size for the pellet system.  It has a 40 HP motor. There is a small 220v blower which takes the feed stock out of the chamber, the hammer mill fills and feeds it into the hopper above the pellet mill. There is a 30' out feed conveyor that the pellets fall onto out of the pellet mill, which also has a variable speed control and is reversible.  There are misc. spare parts included.

    "description": "The Wood Beaver Firewood Wrapper System is designed to quickly stretch-wrap bundles of firewood. These machines are designed to wrap firewood from 12\"\u009d to 24\"\u009d long. The tension spring clutch adjusts how tight the wrap stretches. With proper tensioning of the clutch spring, you can nearly double the length of the wrap. This produces a clean, economical, self-tightening bundle easily stored & carried. Open ended bundles allow the wood to dry in storage. The Wood Beaver Twister is fast, 12 to 15 second actual wrap time plus loading & unloading. Rates of 75 bundles and up per hour are common for a single operator, or over 110 bundles per hour with two operators. Quick-load baskets available. Equipped with \u00bd HP (40 rpm) Leeson electric motor (HD gear reduction). Available in adjustable \u00be\"\u009d or 1\"\u009d cubic foot configurations. Free ground freight (to a commercial address) is included to the lower 48 states! US Patent #7,516,694"

    "description": "Galvastar aluminum end gates are available in standard or heavy duty configurations. We're currently developing an end gate that swivels 90 degrees which can increase your mileage by up to 1 mpg when the trailer is unloaded. Watch video below to see how it works. We're also developing a gate raising system which allows you to raise or lower the end gates depending on your load size. There's also a video of this below."

    "description": "Galvastar Galvanized Trailers. Hot Dipped Galvanizing is the process of immersing steel in a bath consisting of 98% pure molten zinc. A metallurgic reaction occurs, forming a coating bond that is stronger than the typical painting process. The galvanized steel provides a durable scratch-resistant coating that help maintain the integrity of the steel and prevent corrosion for over 75 years! The Galvastar trailer frame is welded together, and the entire assembly is then hot dipped for maximum coverage and weld protection. This galvanizing process ensures long-lasting corrosion protection that makes for a reasonably priced & virtually maintenance free trailer. Galvanizing provides superior rust protection & increases resistance to surface damage on your trailer. Our galvanized 47', 3-axle 5-bunk trailer is made from high strength, light weight \"T-1\" steel which is hot dipped in 800 degree zinc. Comes with aluminum wheels, aluminum front & rear end gates, air weight guage, 30k axles & suspension, font & rear lift axles & weighs in at 13,800 lbs. Don Dens is your #1 source for log trailers, trailer parts & accessories."

A typical 18\"\u009d hardwood log is cut in 3-4 seconds and splits in 3-4 seconds or less!!! It's a drag race to see which finishes its job first! The 18 BAB comes standard with almost everything, choose your engine and how you plan to live deck, dead deck, or log lift), that's it. If you need to get your production into the 3+ cords per hour range, the 18 BAB is one Bad A** Beaver!"
