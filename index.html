This machine comes standard with a 2-strand live deck that can convert into a log lift. The integrated 10' hydraulic operated chain conveyor allows you to easily load firewood into a trailer or truck box. Hydraulic lever type controls operate the hydraulic saw, clamp, conveyor, and log lift. All 14-24's come standard with a hydraulically operated 4-way wedge, automatic bar oiler, last log measuring grid, and integrated taillights. Our one of a kind round log trough is built to better handle crooked logs at ease. A perfect machine for the homeowner who cuts firewood to heat his home or has a small firewood business. While the 14-24 is the smallest machine in the Brute Force line of processors, it is designed &amp; built to the same standards as our larger machines. All Brute Force firewood processors are built to withstand the rigors of daily firewood production. https://youtu.be/zr49fg9j5iQ</td>

      <td>Galvastar Galvanized Trailers. Hot Dipped Galvanizing is the process of immersing steel in a bath consisting of 98% pure molten zinc. A metallurgic reaction occurs, forming a coating bond that is stronger than the typical painting process. The galvanized steel provides a durable scratch-resistant coating that help maintain the integrity of the steel and prevent corrosion for over 75 years! The Galvastar trailer frame is welded together, and the entire assembly is then hot dipped for maximum coverage and weld protection. This galvanizing process ensures long-lasting corrosion protection that makes for a reasonably priced &amp; virtually maintenance free trailer. Galvanizing provides superior rust protection &amp; increases resistance to surface damage on your trailer. Our galvanized 47', 3-axle 5-bunk trailer is made from high strength, light weight "T-1" steel which is hot dipped in 800 degree zinc. Comes with aluminum wheels, aluminum front &amp; rear end gates, air weight guage, 30k axles &amp; suspension, font &amp; rear lift axles &amp; weighs in at 13,800 lbs.

The hammer mill, feed conveyor, and auger in the feed bin are controlled with sensing units so that the mill cannot be over fed and jam up. As the amps on the hammer mill climb the feed auger slows, when the amps reach a pre-set limit the feed conveyor stops to allow the hammer mill to catch up. This is all 3 phase 240v components. The hammer mill has a 1/4" screen, which is the correct size for the pellet system. It has a 40 HP motor. There is a small 220v blower which takes the feed stock out of the chamber, the hammer mill fills and feeds it into the hopper above the pellet mill. There is a 30' out feed conveyor that the pellets fall onto out of the pellet mill, which also has a variable speed control and is reversible. There are misc. spare parts included.

Bigger, stronger, and faster than it's predecessor, the model 18 BAB is a true animal powered by either a Kohler CH999 gas engine or a Kubota 902 diesel, and equipped with a Parker VOAC 7135 rpm saw motor, 404 18H 24" true harvester combination - this is by far the fastest cut/split combi-nation on the market. A typical 18" hardwood log is cut in 3-4 seconds and splits in 3-4 seconds or less!!! It's a drag race to see which finishes its job first! The 18 BAB comes standard with almost everything, choose your engine and how you plan to live deck, dead deck, or log lift), that's it. If you need to get your production into the 3+ cords per hour range, the 18 BAB is one Bad A** Beaver!</td>

      <td>The Wood Beaver Firewood Wrapper System is designed to quickly stretch-wrap bundles of firewood. These machines are designed to wrap firewood from 12" to 24" long. The tension spring clutch adjusts how tight the wrap stretches. With proper tensioning of the clutch spring, you can nearly double the length of the wrap. This produces a clean, economical, self-tightening bundle easily stored &amp; carried. Open ended bundles allow the wood to dry in storage. The Wood Beaver Twister is fast, 12 to 15 second actual wrap time plus loading &amp; unloading. Rates of 75 bundles and up per hour are common for a single operator, or over 110 bundles per hour with two operators. Quick-load baskets available. Equipped with ½ HP (40 rpm) Leeson electric motor (HD gear reduction). Available in adjustable ¾" or 1" cubic foot configurations. Free ground freight (to a commercial address) is included to the lower 48 states! US Patent #7,516,694</td>

      <td>The Automated Firewood conveyor is durable firewood conveyor that is available in 16', 24' &amp; 32' lengths. Conveyor comes standard with a 20" wide smooth rubber belt conveyor, with a paddle belt available as an option. This product is designed in direct response to our customers' need for a reliable firewood conveyor that contributes to efficient production for any firewood operation Power Pack: Our power pack consists of a quiet, reliable fuel efficient Honda GX160 engine along with a Parker gear pump providing reliable operation for the lifetime of the machine. The unit is capable of propelling the belt at up to 350' per minute. Hydraulics: We utilize high quality Parker hoses and motors to allow for flexible speed, durable operation and years of trouble free service. Ribbed Belt: This option allows an operator to move material more efficiently and in all-weather at steeper angles. Debris Separator: The optional debris separator is a series of discs that rotate &amp; when mounted on a conveyor, separates the fines and the kindling from your wood, to improve customer satisfaction and product handling, &amp; remove unwanted waste &amp; debris from your cut &amp; split firewood. Oversized Hopper: This option allows an operator to load firewood, mulch or any other material of similar density into a full height semi trailer with smaller loader such as a skid steer. This option also adds a jack and torsion bar suspension to improve on road performance and overall machine flexibility. Shipping and financing available. Contact Matt @ 970-658-6249.</td>
